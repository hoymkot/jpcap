To use device name from PacketCapture.findDevice(), everything as "{}" must be drop from the string to process further. 
For example:  
before processing 
             \Device\NPF_{A87F459C-4FF6-4866-9076-E1202B7B757B}
                  Sun
after processing 
            \Device\NPF_{A87F459C-4FF6-4866-9076-E1202B7B757B}    <== only this part
